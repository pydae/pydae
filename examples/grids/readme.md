- dqd: From Andrés León model, dq coordinates dynamic model 
- dqc: the same as in dqd but capacitor differential equtions  are transformed to algebraic equations.
- dqa: the same as in dqd but without dynamics. ODE are transformed to algebraic.
- uir: pydgrid grid model, phasor domain in SI units, each phase/neutral wire is modeled.
- bpu: classic power flow per unit model, balanced network.
